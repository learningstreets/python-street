print("1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.")
print("2. A variable name can not start with a number.")
print("3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores.")
print("4. A variable names are case-sensitive.")


print("*********Key Points*********")

print("Python changes the data type depends upon the values that has been set.")

print("Whenever the expression changes, Python associates a new Object (a chunk of memory) to the variables for referencing that value. And the old one goes to the Garbage Collector.")

print("memory address of test=10 is: ", id(test))

test=11
print("memory address of test=11 is: ", id(test))


print("Python builds a cache and reuses some of the immutable Objects, such as small integers and strings, to optimize the performance.")


print("*********Python Variables Data Types*********")


 
 
print("1. In python, we do not need to declare a variable with explixitly mentioning the data type. This feature is foamously known as dynamic typing.")
print("2. Python determines type of a literal directly from the syntac at runtime.")
print("3. Everythin in Python is a object; variables, functions, modules etc.")
print("4. Variable do not have types, instead they are just labels in Python. It is the value which gets associated with a type. Hence, the same variable, the label can refer values of different Python data types.")
